FHIR – Pirate

FHIR-Pirate is a SMART on FHIR web application made using Bootstrap, Angular framework, HAPI and EPIC EHRs (FHIR APIs) with in-memory Database.
SMART - Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies (SMART) is a healthcare standard that adds a layer of security in front of FHIR interfaces to support safe access to data held within an Electronic Health Record (EHR) – or any other repository.
FHIR -  FHIR is a machine readable specification of a REST server. FHIR is like the Swagger/OpenAPI for health IT. While Swagger gives you generic tools to specify any REST API, FHIR goes a couple of steps further and gives you ready-to-use informational models and operational semantic along with ways to extend the data models for your specific use case.
HAPI, EPIC, AllScripts, Cerner -  public (open) FHIR EHRs for patient database.

HealthCare is moving towards digitization very rapidly and FHIR provides the most vital tool in this revolution, interoperability. Medical Data interoperability will solve a multitude of problems which currently cause a number of issues when using medical data from EMR's/EHR's .The patient data will be used in a way which is completely secure yet transparent, the diagnosis and the treatment of any kind of diseases will become precise and accurate. This app leverages this inherent quality of FHIR which this model was developed to provide.
